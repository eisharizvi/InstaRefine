## Synopsis
This project will create an easy-to-use mobile app for Android that allows users to edit, enhance, and manipulate images. The app will be built using Dart and Flutter and will include features like brightness adjustment, contrast control, cropping, etc. 
Key Features
### Brightness Adjustment: 
Users can increase or decrease brightness using a simple slider.
### Contrast Control:
Users can modify contrast to make the image sharper or softer.
### Cropping: 
A cropping tool will allow users to cut and resize specific parts of the image.
# Filters and Effects: 
Basic filters like grayscale, sepia, and blur will be available for users to apply.
### Undo and Redo: 
Users can undo or redo recent edits for flexibility.
### Save and Export: 
Edited images can be saved in formats like JPEG or PNG.

## Technologies
Dart: A programming language for app logic.
Flutter: Framework for building the user interface and app functionality.
Image Processing Libraries: These are used to handle image editing tasks.
Android SDK: For deploying the app to Android devices.
User Interface (UI): The UI will be built with Flutter's widgets, providing easy access to editing tools through sliders and buttons.
Image Processing Techniques: Brightness and contrast adjustments involve pixel-level changes, while cropping allows users to select specific image parts. Filters will be applied using matrix transformations.
